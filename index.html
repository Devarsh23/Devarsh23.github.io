								<span class="image main"><img src="images/check5.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p align = justify><p align = justify>By nature, I am a believer and a tech geek. I enjoy using current technology to solve problems. My goal is to create and scale smart products that will make people's lives easier. To do so, I form teams, adapt to new information, and conquer challenges.</p>

									<p align = justify>I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Boston. Also, I am a Data Engineer Intern at AppFolio Inc I'm good at making data-driven judgments and enjoy working on data and software related initiatives.
									I worked as an AI Intern at Teksun Inc during my undergraduate studies, where I designed an AI-based edge processing health assisting device. I handled the entire project by myself, from data collecting to implementation (in under three months), demonstrating my dedication, perseverance, and technical expertise.<p align = justify>
									
									<p align = justify>I can state the following about myself based on my personal and professional experiences:</p>
									<ul>- I'm great at leading projects and managing teams.</ul>
									<ul>- I am a skilled communicator.</ul>
									<ul>- I make decisions based on data</ul>
									<ul>- Every day, I educate and refine myself to become a better person.</ul>
									Meeting new people and obtaining new experiences are two of my favorite things to do. I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and consuming anything that can help me grow, broaden my horizons, or rethink my viewpoints on various topics.

								<h3>More details about me</h3><p align = justify>A little kid with a fascination for computers to a grown-up technology graduate, my journey with one of the greatest inventions of the world has been a good one. There is no sector where the computer hasn’t pervaded; the technology has become a conventional imperative everywhere. The computer began its role in my life as a guide for making better school projects. At that time, I knew little about what went into making the device. It was in high school that I studied the basics of computer programming. With Mathematics and Science being my favorite fields of study, programming was a topic that complemented my logical brain, and I went on to pursue Computer Engineering as a Bachelor’s program at state’s one of the top government college. My four-year journey in the domain has given my career goals a better direction and has added several of the essential skills required to enter this dynamic field.</p>
							<p align = justify>In school, I often heard the statement that computers have changed the world and that there is still a lot more to happen. The undergraduate program gave me exposure to the process involved behind these changes. With a fair understanding of the C language from high school years, I studied several other programming languages during the program, with a focus on Python programming. Subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Mining led towards the field of Computer Science, which I intend to study further. Through a multitude of case studies, practical sessions, theory classes, and, most importantly, project work, I got a comprehensive base of knowledge for learning at the Master’s level.</p>
							<p align = justify>Projects had been an integral part of every semester, and I applied my learning to the best of my capabilities. Given the current pandemic conditions, I tried to contribute my share of knowledge through a project on Social Distancing that applied the technology of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. The system had a camera that could detect people in the frame along with their Euclidian distance and send alerts if people did not comply with social distancing norms. Further applying skills in Machine Learning, I developed a House Prediction System, which was deployed in an end-to-end manner with Heroku, and this was my project in the hackathon, which won me a runner-up price. Adding colors to black and white images was one of my most interesting projects. Through Deep Learning Techniques, Generative Adversarial Network, TensorFlow, and Tkinter, we developed a system that could add appropriate colors to black and white photographs as well as handmade pencil sketches. These projects have given me a sound understanding of how to apply technical concepts with precision, thus elevating my abilities for better performance in the field of Computer Science.</p>
						    <p align = justify>While practical studies are essential in the technological industry, research also holds a significant position as a source of in-depth knowledge. Exploring topics and going into the depth of details has been a habit with me since school days. Hence during the undergraduate program, I researched several topics of interest and compiled a research paper as well as a review paper along with one conference paper. The review paper describes an idea that can be potentially applied to universities to stop forgery in degree certificates and maintain a lifelong record of students, and it is accepted at the Augmented Human Research, Springer. The research paper depicts the system about the combination of Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology to Eliminate Forgery in Education, which is currently published at springer. I am also awaiting my conference to be published soon, which is under review in IEEE. In this paper, I have extended my work at internship into a conference paper, which assists blind people to read documents efficiently. I also share my knowledge as a technical blog writer in the Online Publication Towards Data Science, which publishes blogs related to the Data Science domain.</p>
						<p align = justify>There is practically no substitute for the experiences that one gets from industrial exposure along with studies; it helps understanding concepts better and relating them to their appropriate usage. As a part of my skill enhancement journey, I underwent a three-month-long internship at Teksun Inc. Here, I have worked on a project named "Hello-AI" where technologies like compute vision were used in the health care domain to accurately determine the heart rate and oxygen levels of the user. Apart from this, I have also worked on a project which detects the violation of social distancing norms in a given live video feed.  Through these projects, I became better acquainted with the application of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Object Detection, Kalman Filter, and Open CV tools as well as Python programming. I further enhanced my practical experience with a 3 months internship at RCSL PVT Ltd, where I have worked on a project on NodeJs. My role here was to do coding for assigned modules. My suggestions for design work and recommendations for making Job portal user-friendly were well appreciated by the Project manager. </p>
						<p align = justify>Expertise in Python programming is one of the basic requirements in excelling in the field of Computer Science. I thus added more inputs on this topic by attending multiple workshops and seminars. Completing an online course in Machine Learning from Stanford University and five courses in Deep Learning Specialization by Deep learning.ai is another step taken in the direction of being more competent in Computer Science.
							I have always been a technology enthusiast, and that reflected in my enthusiasm for events like coding competitions and quizzes held during the University Tech Fest. My college activities also include social services like blood donation and volunteering for environmental campaigns initiated by the university. My academic journey so far has been a great one, teaching me valuable lessons in resource management and effective interaction with people, which are necessary skills in every field as well as on the personal front.

							<p align = justify>Computer vision can significantly enhance the quality of life of visually disabled people. In
								this area, we have been working on a wearable device, which will help the visually impaired
								in their daily life. Our approach relies on a custom trained object detection model, image
								processing techniques and raspberry pi having a camera and headphones attached. System
								first captures the image and uses image processing techniques on this image. Then this image
								is given to custom trained object detection model and output is sent via speech. The system
								also offers the functionality of user input through haptic feedback, as well as audio messages.
								Moreover, the output will be enunciated by the headphones. So, the blind person can easily
								understand the result of the system</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Product.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p align = justify>The picture without a colour is like a boat without a helm. This sentence specifies the importance of colour in aspect of viewing picture so we decided to perform this project by which we can provide a better alternative coloured image despite of black and white. The added feature, here is that we can give the hint to the various areas to black and white to colour according to that hint.
									So, in such situation by using the technology like deep learning we can help the people in certain public area to colourized their old photos. Hence the aim of this project is to colourized the black and white image.</p>
